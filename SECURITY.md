## üîê Firebase Security Rules

### Firestore Rules Example

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    // Supplies can be read by authenticated users
    match /supplies/{document} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
    }

    // Applications can be managed by the user who created them
    match /applications/{document} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
    }
  }
}
```

### Storage Rules Example

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /supplies/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

## üö´ Known Security Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **File Upload**: Basic file type validation only
2. **Rate Limiting**: No rate limiting implemented
3. **Audit Logging**: Limited audit trail
4. **2FA**: Two-factor authentication not implemented

### Planned Security Improvements

1. **Enhanced File Validation**: Advanced file scanning
2. **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting implementation
3. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail
4. **2FA Support**: Two-factor authentication
5. **Encryption**: Additional data encryption layers
